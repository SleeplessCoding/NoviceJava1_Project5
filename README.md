# NoviceJava1_Project5

The finalized program from project 1-4 adaptations, after adding the ability to create multiple objects using an array and then running the computeAverageSales and computeShippingChargesg methods. In this finalization we are showing and displaying the program and how it functions. From start to finish.
First I created the individual objects but found that the array allows for a much smaller program I set the array parameters for only 3 allocated spaces to keep the temporary size of the program memory requirements low and being that we only need to create 2 objects for this assignment

Pseudocode:

START {

Create an array car[] in our main from our car class

Create Object 1 using the array from the car class

Display Object 1 attributes from user input

Create Object 2 using the array from the car class

Display Object 2 attributes from user input

Call computeAverageSales()

Call computeShippingCharges()

} END


The finalized ordering application with sales calculations and an array to store multiple orders/items.
